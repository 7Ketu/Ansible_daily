			ansible all -m file -a 'path=/tmp/test state=file mode=600'



			state=touch: for creating a new file

			state=file: for an existing file

			Note: if you use state=file for a non existing file, it will fail



			so if you want to make a new file with permision 600

			you can use:

			#ansible all -m file 'path=/tmp/test_unix state=touch mode=600'
